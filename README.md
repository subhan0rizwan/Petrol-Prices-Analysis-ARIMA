# Introduction

In the contemporary world, fuel prices significantly impact both the global economy and the daily lives of individuals. As a critical component of transportation and logistics, fluctuations in petrol prices can lead to widespread economic repercussions. Accurate predictions of petrol prices are, therefore, invaluable for government agencies, businesses, and consumers.

## Project Objective:

This project aims to develop a robust and reliable model for predicting petrol prices using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) methodology. By leveraging historical data, this project seeks to forecast future petrol prices, thus providing stakeholders with insights that can aid in decision-making and strategic planning.

## Why ARIMA?

The ARIMA model is a powerful tool in time series analysis, known for its flexibility and effectiveness in capturing the temporal dependencies within data. Its ability to handle different types of data trends and seasonalities makes it a suitable choice for forecasting petrol prices, which are influenced by many factors, including geopolitical events, market demand, and seasonal variations.

Structure of the Project
The project is structured into several stages, each focusing on a crucial aspect of the model development process:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gathering historical petrol price data, cleaning the dataset, and preparing it for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the underlying patterns and characteristics of the data through visualizations and statistical analysis.
ARIMA Model Building: Constructing and fine-tuning the ARIMA model to best capture the dynamics of petrol prices.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the model using various metrics and validating its predictive accuracy.
Forecasting: Using the trained ARIMA model to make future predictions and interpreting the results.
Conclusion and Future Work: Summarizing the findings and discussing potential improvements and future research directions.
Significance
The ability to accurately predict petrol prices holds significant economic and strategic value. For businesses, it can lead to better budgeting and cost management. For policymakers, it provides a basis for regulatory decisions and economic planning. For consumers, it offers insights that can inform personal financial decisions.

Through this project, we aim to demonstrate the practical application of the ARIMA model in time series forecasting and highlight its potential to deliver meaningful predictions in the context of petrol prices.
